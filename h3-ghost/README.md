3. **A MySQL Database and User**  
   Ghost needs a database to store your blog content.  
   👉 Create one by following this guide:

   💡 Write down these details:

## 📥 Step-by-Step Installation

Stop your Node.JS Application before doing the next steps !

Now that everything is ready, let’s install Ghost!

### 🔗 Step 1: Connect to Your Hosting via SSH

Open your computer's **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) or **Command Prompt/Powershell** (Windows), and type:

```bash
ssh yourusername@your-hosting-domain
```

> Replace:
> - `yourusername` → your Node.js SSH username
> - `your-hosting-domain` → something like `XX-XXXXXX.ssh.hosting-ik.com`

📌 Example:
```bash
ssh john@XX-XXXXXX.ssh.hosting-ik.com
```

- Press **Enter**
- Type **yes** if asked to continue
- Enter your **SSH password** (you won’t see letters as you type — that’s normal!)

You should now see a prompt like this:
```bash
[client@ik-xxx... ~]$
```

✅ You're connected!


### 📄 Step 2: Clone and Run the installation script

Run these commands one by one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Infomaniak/hosting-tools.git
cd hosting-tools/h3-ghost
bash ./install.sh
```

💡 The script will now:
- Ask you some questions (like your site URL, database info, etc.)
- Download and set up Ghost automatically
- Take a few minutes — be patient!
Answer the questions carefully using the database details you wrote down earlier.
> 🛑 Don’t close the terminal until it finishes!

### ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Your Hosting (via Infomaniak Panel)

Once the script is done, go to your **Infomaniak Control Panel**:

1. Go to your **Node.js Hosting** dashboard
2. Click on your site → **"Advanced Settings"**
3. Make these changes:
   - 🔲 **Build command**: Disable it
   - 🟢 **Run command**: Paste this exactly:
     ```
     /srv/customer/node_modules/ghost-cli/bin/ghost run
     ```
   - 🔢 **Port**: `3000`
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Start** (or restart if already running)
